# FIFO Sockets Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the creation and utilization of FIFO (named pipes) in an Android environment. Named pipes provide a way for processes to communicate with each other by reading from and writing to a designated file. This project focuses on implementing FIFO sockets to facilitate inter-process communication (IPC).

## Features

- Creation of named pipes (FIFO)
- Read and write operations between processes
- Handling storage permissions for accessing FIFO
- Example use cases demonstrating IPC

## Requirements

- Android Studio
- Android SDK
- Basic knowledge of Java and Android development


## Accessing Executable Files
- After compiling the app, you can find the executable files for both architectures in the following directories:
# for 32bit
- build\intermediates\cxx\Debug\4ga1y1s1\obj\local\armeabi-v7a\executable\objs
# for 64bit
- build\intermediates\cxx\Debug\4ga1y1s1\obj\local\arm64-v8a\objs
